# RayTracer
CPU ray tracer in .NET Core. Studying the basics from *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
while implementing it in C# instead of C++ (for familiarity and to avoid blind copy-pasting).

Not very efficient, but should atleast burn on all cores.

##  Features to be implemented
* Dielectrics
* Positionable camera
* Defocus blur
* Parsing scene files
* Other volumes than spheres
* Utilizing GPU
